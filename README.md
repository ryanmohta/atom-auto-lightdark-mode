# Same Atom themes, now synced with your system.

![Animation between light and dark mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19882060/129186100-b5e8156a-dd3d-4dc3-8db4-737d261748ae.png)

I use both light and dark mode regularly: light mode in the daytime and dark mode at night. macOS makes this super simple by automatically switching between modes based on the time of day, and many apps (including all built-in apps and most third-party apps like Discord and GitHub Desktop) sync their local light/dark mode preference with the operating system. That is, ***except for Atom!!***

Atom has very good light and dark mode themes, but no built-in way to sync the current theme with your macOS settings â€” forcing me to manually switch the Atom theme twice a day. Thankfully, Atom features an extensive [package library](https://atom.io/packages) and [API](https://flight-manual.atom.io/api/v1.57.0/AtomEnvironment/) to extend its base capabilities, which I made use of here!

This might be the smallest repo I've ever made on GitHub, but will definitely prove to be one of the most helpful! :atom:
